# Two-stage-speed-reducer

Electric motor rotates at higher speed than is required by assembly line conveyor belt, the two stage speed reducer is intended to be used as a middle ground in order to convert the input speed to a lower output speed that can be safely used.

To meet the design requirements, various concepts were evaluated, and the selected design represents the optimal balance. It was designed to be as simple as possible to ensure ease of maintenance and high reliability. The design features three independent shafts that drive four separate spur gears, reducing the speed to the desired ratio. Spur gears were chosen for their efficiency and compatibility with the straightforward design.
